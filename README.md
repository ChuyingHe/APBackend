# Architecture
Detail explanation sees [Explicit Architecture](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/).
App uses onion architecture that leverages <b>Inversion of Control</b>. 
`core/` knows nothing but itself; 
`infrastructure/` has access to itself and everything in `core/`;
`presentation/` knows everything in the app.
```
core <-- infrastructure <-- presentation
```
The directory tree looks like this:
```
app/
├── core/
├── infrastructure/
└── presentation/
```
## core/
This part includes the main Business Logic of the app, which actually do the work.
```
app/
├── core/
        ├── abstractions/
        ├── domain/
        └── services/
...
```

## infrastructure/
This part connects the `core/` to other tools like Database, search engine, or other third party APIs.
```
app/
├── core/
├── infrastructure/
        ├── adapters/
        └── database/
...
```

## presentation/
This part is responsible to communicate with external world, receiving or sending infos.
```
app/
├── core/
├── infrastructure/
└── presentation/
        └── api/
```
